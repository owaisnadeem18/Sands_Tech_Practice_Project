                <p className="mt-4 text-pretty text-lg leading-[165%]">Creating animations on the web often means choosing between visual fidelity and performance.</p>
                <p className="mt-4 text-pretty text-lg leading-[165%]">Superpower was our first experiment in scroll-driven animation. Using MP4s got us partway there but revealed key limitations: full loading upfront, compression artifacts, and browser-specific issues like Safari pausing playback on devices in low-power mode.</p>
                <p className="mt-4 text-pretty text-lg leading-[165%]">When we began work on Adaline's site, we saw an opportunity to push the interaction further. Studying image sequences, we found the detail and cross-browser consistency we'd been missing, but also new performance challenges to solve.</p>
                <p className="mt-4 text-pretty text-lg leading-[165%]">This time, we weren't interested in compromise. By rethinking each part of the interaction, we made a series of targeted design and engineering choices to shape an experience that delivers both quality and speed.</p>

                <h2 className="mt-12 text-pretty text-2xl font-[450] text-neutral-600">Image Compression</h2>
                <p className="mt-4 text-pretty text-lg leading-[165%]">We began by prototyping a CLI-based compression pipeline: extracting PNG frames from a 4K MP4 using <Link href="https://ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg.html" className="text-pretty text-neutral-400 hover:underline">FFmpeg</Link>, then converting them to WebP with Google's <Link href="https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/cwebp" className="text-pretty text-neutral-400 hover:underline">cwebp</Link> utility.</p>
                <p className="mt-4 text-pretty text-lg leading-[165%]">Early tests turned a 700MB video into 500 PNG frames totalling 2,000MB. After downscaling these to 2K resolution webp images, we compressed the full set to just 30MB, resulting in a 99% reduction in file size with no perceptible loss in visual quality.</p>
                <p className="mt-4 text-pretty text-lg leading-[165%]">Later, our motion team streamlined the workflow by exporting JPEG sequences directly from Cinema4D. This let us skip frame extraction and use an image compression CLI tool called <Link href="http://www.graphicsmagick.org/" className="text-pretty text-neutral-400 hover:underline">GraphicsMagick</Link> compress the PNG images to JPEG. After our attempts to compress every individual frame and cut half of the frames, we realized there were still unresolved edge cases. For users on mobile, rendering a full-bleed 16:9 video layout (similar to â€˜object-fit: cover') crops out two-thirds of the image. We were loading data that never reached the screen.</p>
                <p className="mt-4 text-pretty text-lg leading-[165%]">Inspired by image sequencing approaches in sites like <Link href="https://opalcamera.com/" className="text-pretty text-neutral-400 hover:underline">Opal Camera</Link>, we implemented conditional rendering to serve mobile-specific sequences. Four distinct variants would be exported: 3:5 and 16:9, each in standard and high resolution. The mobile versions were compressed more aggressively to better accommodate smaller screens and cellular bandwidth.</p>

                <h2 className="mt-12 text-pretty text-2xl font-[450] text-neutral-600">Progressive Loading</h2>
                <p className="mt-4 text-pretty text-lg leading-[165%]">To prevent blocking user interaction, we tried a sparse loading algorithm that aimed to completely eliminate all pre-loaders. It streamed in every eighth frame, every fourth, every second, until the entire sequence was complete. Users could interact immediately, and playback was still usable at a lower frame rate while new frames were being streamed in. The problem with sequential loading is that users who scrolled quickly through the sequence would skip ahead of the loaded frames and never see how the video ends.</p>

                </figure>
                <p className="mt-4 text-pretty text-lg leading-[165%]">We used a technique inspired by <Link href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_space_partitioning" className="text-pretty text-neutral-400 hover:underline">binary space partitioning</Link>, which is commonly known for its use in Doom. This technique was famously used by John Carmack, where he applied academic research to speed up map rendering in the game engine using recursive subdivision. Similarly, the final version of the website loads the first and last frame of the sequence as keyframes, finds the midpoints, and loads the frames at the midpoints recursively until the entire sequence is filled in.</p>

                </figure>
                <p className="mt-4 text-pretty text-lg leading-[165%]">After we found the correct loading algorithm, we realized a loader was important to block the user interaction to only load the first 20 frames so the experience would be usable. It was important to maintain a high quality visual experience and not only think about how to get the user into the site as quickly as possible.</p>
                <h2 className="mt-12 text-pretty text-2xl font-[450] text-neutral-600">Maintaining Visual Continuity</h2>
                <p className="mt-4 text-pretty text-lg leading-[165%]">Since it loads data non-sequentially, the wave based loading algorithm created a side effect. If the user was scrolling forwards, the canvas would immediately try to display the newly loaded frames even if they belonged to an earlier part of the sequence, breaking visual continuity. By tracking the scroll direction, we can set a condition for the canvas to only render the nearest loaded frame in the user's scroll direction regardless of the order frames are loaded.</p>

                <h2 className="mt-12 text-pretty text-2xl font-[450] text-neutral-600">Frame Timing</h2>
                <p className="mt-4 text-pretty text-lg leading-[165%]">If the user scrolls really quickly, they might traverse hundreds of frames in a fraction of a second, far more than their display's refresh rate. Redrawing the canvas on every scroll event would cause dropped frames, so we solved this with <Link href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/requestAnimationFrame" className="text-pretty text-neutral-400 hover:underline"><code className="text-pretty rounded bg-gray-100 px-1 text-sm">requestAnimationFrame()</code></Link> to synchronize frame rendering with the display's refresh rate resulting in smooth playback regardless of scroll speed.</p>
                <h2 className="mt-12 text-pretty text-2xl font-[450] text-neutral-600">Custom Easing &amp; Frame Distribution</h2>
                <p className="mt-4 text-pretty text-lg leading-[165%]">We had a discussion with the motion team to either bake the easing directly into the 3D render or control it dynamically in code. Since rendering a single video can take up to ten hours, we implemented a cubic bezier function in our component (similar to the implementations seen in CSS easing or animation libraries). This let us prototype different easing values without re-rendering the scene.</p>
                <p className="mt-4 text-pretty text-lg leading-[165%]">One subtle tradeoff of this approach is how easing affects perceived frame rate during scroll. In steeper parts of the curve where time is compressed, more frames are packed into the scroll distance, effectively accelerating visual progress. Scrolling during this section feels like smooth high-FPS playback.</p>
                <p className="mt-4 text-pretty text-lg leading-[165%]">In contrast, flatter parts of the curve stretch time. The same scroll distance advances the video more slowly, since there are fewer frames distributed along this part of the curve. This creates more sparse low-FPS playback, especially when scrolling slowly where users may notice larger visual gaps between frames.</p>
                <p className="mt-4 text-pretty text-lg leading-[165%]">The total number of frames is constant, but their visual distribution over scroll is non-uniform based on the slope of the easing curve.</p>

                <h2 className="mt-12 text-pretty text-2xl font-[450] text-neutral-600">Dynamic Quality Rendering</h2>
                <p className="mt-4 text-pretty text-lg leading-[165%]">As the product's launch approached, our design engineering team faced internal tensions on whether to optimize for performance or visual fidelity. Some pushed for aggressive optimization, even suggesting to remove the image sequence altogether for users on slower connections, while others wanted to prioritize delivering the highest quality experience under the assumption that most users would be on high-bandwidth internet.</p>
                <p className="mt-4 text-pretty text-lg leading-[165%]">Instead of serving high quality images throughout the entire experience, we dynamically change the render quality based on the user's movement. When the user scrolls, we serve a lower-quality sequence, leveraging the fact that motion naturally masks compression artifacts. When scrolling stops, a 350ms debounce triggers the loading of higher-resolution frames, restoring detail only when it's most likely to be seen and appreciated.</p>
